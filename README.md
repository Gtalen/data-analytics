This repository contains my analysis of the popular [Palmer penguins dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv). 

## BACKGROUND

The analysis started off by importing the necessary libraries needed for data analysis, exploration, manipulation and visualization and the [Palmer penguins dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv). The palmer penguin dataset has 344 rows and 7 columns and each of the row represents a penguin included in the study. The  dataset consists of three species of penguins; Adelie, Gentoo and Chinstrap found in Biscoe, Dream and Torgersen Island in Australia.
